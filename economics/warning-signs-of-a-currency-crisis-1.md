large inflows of foreign capital occurs when financial markets have been liberalized and domestic banks have borrowed abroad.

if the borrowing is denominated in a foreign currency and the domestic currency initially depreciates, the bank may have trouble serving its debt.
especially when the debt is of shorter maturity.

if the government is trying to maintain the currency's value,
it could increase the interest rate or buy its own currency using foreign currency reserves.
